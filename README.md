# WEBGL STL Viewer

WIP 2024.

This project has it's origins as an advanced NURB modeler, however I decided to branch out a part of the program and created this STL file viewer.

Various things that can be done are...
* Import ASCII and binary STL files, export them separately or together as a binary STL file.
* Rotate, scale and transform imported STL files, indepently or together.
* Choose which mesh gets displayed and which will not, optimal for an efficient viewing experience.

# Usage
The STL file viewer at it's core is an easy program to audit multiple STL files at the same time. The key functionality can be accessed through the canvas UI, or with the keybinds below.

WIP 2024.

Various keybinds that can be used are......

- `WASD` To move around the scene.
- `R` To rotate the current selection around the specified axis.
- `G` To move the current selection.
- `T` To scale the current selection to the desired size.
- `P` If you want to import either an ASCII or binary STL file.
